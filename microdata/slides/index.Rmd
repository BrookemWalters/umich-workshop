## Part 1: Using ACS microdata with tidycensus

---

## What is "microdata?"  

.pull-left[

* __Microdata__: individual-level survey responses made available to researchers 

* The ACS Public Use Microdata Series (PUMS) allows for detailed cross-tabulations not available in aggregated data

* The 1-year PUMS covers about 1 percent of the US population; the 5-year PUMS covers about 5 percent (so, not the full ACS)

]

## Microdata resources: Census website

## Microdata resources: IPUMS

## Microdata resources: ipumsr

## Microdata and the Census API

## Using microdata in tidycensus

---

## Setting up tidycensus

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidycensus)

census_api_key("YOUR KEY GOES HERE", install = TRUE)
```


---

## Basic usage of `get_pums()`

.pull-left[

* `get_pums()` requires specifying one or more variables and the state for which you'd like to request data.  `state = 'all'` _can_ get data for the entire USA, but it takes a while!

* The function defaults to the 5-year ACS with `survey = "acs5"`; 1-year ACS data is available with `survey = "acs1"`. 

* The default year is 2019; data are available back to {year}

]


.pull-right[

```{r}
library(tidycensus)

wy_pums <- get_pums(
  variables = c("SEX", "AGEP", "SCHL"),
  state = "WY",
  survey = "acs1",
  year = 2019
)
```

]

---

```{r}
wy_pums
```

---

## Understanding default data from `get_pums()`

`get_pums()` returns some technical variables by default without the user needing to request them specifically.  These include: 

* `SERIALNO`: a serial number that uniquely identifies households in the sample; 

* `SPORDER`: the order of the person in the household; when combined with `SERIALNO`, uniquely identifies a person;

* `WGTP`: the household weight;

* `PWGTP`: the person weight

---

## Weights and ACS microdata

* Given that PUMS data are a _sample_ of the US population, the weights columns must be used for analysis

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

wy_age_50 <- filter(wy_pums, AGEP == 50)

print(sum(wy_pums$PWGTP))
print(sum(wy_age_50$PWGTP))
```

## Working with PUMS variables

---

## Variables available in the ACS PUMS

```{r, eval = FALSE}
View(pums_variables)
```

---

## Understanding PUMS variables

{info here}

---

## Recoding PUMS variables

```{r}
wy_pums_recoded <- get_pums(
  variables = c("SEX", "AGEP", "SCHL"),
  state = "WY",
  survey = "acs1",
  year = 2019,
  recode = TRUE
)
```

---

```{r}
wy_pums_recoded
```

---

## Using variables filters

* PUMS datasets - especially from the 5-year ACS - can get quite large.  The `variables_filter` argument can return a subset of data from the API, reducing long download times

```{r}
wy_pums_filtered <- get_pums(
  variables = c("SEX", "AGEP", "SCHL"),
  state = "WY",
  survey = "acs5",
  variables_filter = list(
    SEX = 2,
    SCHL = 16:20
  ),
  year = 2019,
  recode = TRUE
)
```

## Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs)

---

## What is a PUMA?

.pull-left[

* Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) are the smallest available geographies at which records are identifiable in the PUMS datasets

* PUMAs are redrawn with each decennial US Census, and typically are home to 100,000-200,000 people

* In large cities, a PUMA will represent a collection of nearby neighborhoods; in rural areas, it might represent several counties across a large area of a state

]

.pull-right[

```{r}
library(tigris)
options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)

wy_pumas <- pumas(state = "WY", cb = TRUE)

plot(wy_pumas$geometry)
```

]

---

## Working with PUMAs in PUMS data

* To get PUMA information in your output data, use the variable code `PUMA`

```{r}
wy_age_by_puma <- get_pums(
  variables = c("PUMA", "AGEP"),
  state = "WY",
  survey = "acs5"
)
```

---

```{r}
wy_age_by_puma
```


---

## Custom queries by PUMA

* The `puma` argument in `get_pums()` can be used to obtain data for a specific PUMA or multiple PUMAs - again reducing long download times if specific geographies are required

```{r}
wy_puma_subset <- get_pums(
  variables = c("PUMA", "AGEP"),
  state = "WY",
  survey = "acs5",
  puma = "00500"
)
```

---

```{r}
wy_puma_subset
```


---

## Part 1 exercises

* Try requesting PUMS data using `get_pums()` yourselves, but for a state other than Wyoming.  

* Use the `pums_variables` dataset to browse the available variables in the PUMS.  Create a custom query with `get_pums()` to request data for variables other than those we've used in the above examples.

## International data with idbr

* Example: how has life expectancy at birth changed in Southeast Asia?

```{r}
laos_lex <- idb5(
  country = c("Laos", "Vietnam", "Cambodia", "Thailand"),
  year = 1995:2021,
  variable = "E0",
  country_name = TRUE
)

ggplot(laos_lex, aes(x = time, y = E0, color = NAME)) + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 18) + 
  geom_line(size = 2) + 
  labs(title = "Change in life expectancy, 1995-2021",
       y = "Life expectancy at birth",
       x = "Year")
```

## International data with idbr

* Example: what 10 countries have the highest total fertility rates in 2021?

```{r}
top_tfr <- idb5(
  country = "all",
  year = 2021,
  variable = "TFR",
  country_name = TRUE
) %>%
  slice_max(TFR, n = 10)
